## üì¶ Project Overview

You have been hired as a consultant to review the superstore‚Äôs operations and help it avoid bankruptcy by identifying opportunities to **increase profitability**, **optimize advertising spend**, and **reduce losses from returns**.

## üßÆ Part 1: Profits & Losses

### Objective:
Identify major **profit** and **loss centers** by analyzing combinations of operational dimensions.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Identify Top Profit and Loss Combinations**
   - Compare dimension pairs (e.g. Subcategory + Region, Shipping Mode + Product ID)
   - Visualize total profits by combination
   - Identify:
     - 2 biggest **profit centers**
     - 2 biggest **loss-makers**

2. **Flag Poor-Performing Products**
   - Visualize profit per product
   - Identify products that consistently lose money
   - Recommend discontinuing these products

3. **Prioritize Subcategories**
   - Identify 3 subcategories to focus on (high profitability, high volume)
   - Identify 3 subcategories to consider stopping (high loss, low demand)
   - Justify selections with bar charts or scatter plots

## üì¢ Part 2: Advertising Strategy

### Objective:
Determine **where and when** advertising will generate strong returns on investment (ROAS).

### Key Tasks:
1. **Evaluate Profitability by State and Month**
   - Analyze monthly average profits by state
   - Identify top 3 state-month combinations for advertising
   - Create line or bar plots to show trends

2. **Calculate Advertising Budget**
   - Estimate average profits in selected periods
   - Apply the 1:5 rule for Return on Ad Spend (spend 1/5 of profits)
   - Recommend max ad spend per state-month based on this formula

## üîÅ Part 3: Returned Items Analysis

### Objective:
Assess the impact of product returns on profitability and identify problem areas.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Integrate Returns Data**
   - LEFT JOIN Returns onto Orders table
   - Create a calculated `Returned` field:
     - `"Yes"` ‚Üí `1`
     - `null` ‚Üí `0`

2. **Analyze Return Rates**
   - Products with highest return rates
   - Customers with highest return rates
   - Visualize with bar plots or ranked tables

3. **Return Rate vs Profitability**
   - Choose a dimension (e.g., State, Category, Shipping Mode)
   - Plot **average profit vs return rate**
   - Make a visual argument for whether to **continue or discontinue** the dimension in question
