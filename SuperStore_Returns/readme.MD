# üì¶ Superstore Returns Analysis

## üß† Project Goal

The Superstore is experiencing a high number of returned orders. As a data analyst, your mission is to uncover the **root causes of these returns**, visualize the insights clearly, and provide actionable recommendations to the CEO on **how to reduce return volume**. This project also involves designing a dashboard and preparing a professional presentation of your findings.

## 1. üîç What Is Causing Returns?

### Worksheets to Create:

1. **Scatterplot: Sales vs Returns by Subcategory**
   - Purpose: Analyze whether high sales volume correlates with high return volume.
   - Insight: Investigate subcategories with high return volumes regardless of sales.

2. **Bar Chart: Return Rate by Product Category**
   - Purpose: Identify which categories have the highest proportion of returns.
   - Insight: Spot problematic categories that may need quality checks or product adjustments.

3. **Return Rate by Customer (Filtered)**
   - Filter: Exclude customers with only one order.
   - Purpose: Detect customers prone to repeated returns.
   - Insight: Potential to flag or follow-up with chronic returners.

4. **Map: Geographic Return Rates**
   - Dimension: State or City
   - Purpose: Discover geographic regions with unusual return behavior.
   - Insight: May indicate issues with regional suppliers or shipping.

5. **Time-Based Return Analysis**
   - Metric: Month or Week
   - Purpose: Identify seasonality in return rates.
   - Insight: Helpful for planning product launches or marketing around return-heavy periods.

6. **Composite Charts**
   - At least two visualizations combining multiple factors like:
     - Return rate by state + category
     - Return rate by time + subcategory
   - Insight: Multidimensional causes of returns for deeper diagnostics.
